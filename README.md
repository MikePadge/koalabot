* https://jquery.com/

To build on Windows:
* Get nw.js
* Pull everything from src on this repository
* Zip it to bot.zip (top level)
* Rename it to bot.nw
* Put bot.nw into the nw.js folder
* Open a console window (shift-rightclick in the folder)
* Run: copy /b nw.exe+bot.nw bot.exe
* You only need bot.exe, nw.pak, and icudtl.dat to run the program... for now at least.
